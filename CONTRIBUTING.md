# Contributing to React Social Network development

We welcome Pull Requests (PR's) as well as having people working on fixing it's current issues. If you are coming to this project new.
If you notice an issue with this app, please feel free to open an issue.

A lot of developers prefer asking if they could contribute or be assigned a task as a reply to a .  This is great.  I have a strict no gatekeeping policy in any of these projects.  

Some tasks may not be beginner friendly even if tagged `good first issue`.. so try and judge the task accordingly.  If you are a beginner, there are smaller tasks a beginner can work on such as style issues.

## Style

I have not created an official style guide yet. If anyone would like to create a style guide for us. Create a Discussion.

The layout is a 3 column layout, starting with desktop view with a 200-250px left panel, 1400-1500px center panel and a 200-250px right panel, similar to Facebook's desktop view when looking at the root '/'.

## Development

If you are not sure what to work on, review the issues list.  There are also TODO's listed in the TODO.md file.

### PR's

    When you do a PR on GitHub, Please make sure you complete the section on the right, Assignees, Reviewers, Labels, Projects, Milestone(s) and Development before you submit the PR.  

- Link an issue to Development that the PR will close
- Make sure that you tag a reviewer i.e. @gbowne1
- Pick labels from Labels
- Make sure you are the assignee to the PR.
- Milestone, choose Frontend or Backend (more may come later on)

### Issues

  @gbowne1 will assign users to issues on a first come, first serve basis. In the future I would like a minimum of 2 people doing Frontend and 2 people doing Backend, then we can assign specific groups of people taking care of things like CSS, Components, etc.

## Editor & IDE

The repository contains folders with project appropriate settings and configurations for Visual Studio and Visual Studio code but beyond that, We are tool and editor/IDE agnostic so you can use whatever editor or IDE or you like.  

## Settings & Configuration

The included workspaces, settings, configurations and plugins are for:

Babel
Webpack
ESLint
Prettier
VSCode (.vscode)
Visual Studio 2019+ (.vs)
GitHub (.github)

These may not be 100% correct, so if you can contribute to them to make them more accurate for React development it is welcomed.
